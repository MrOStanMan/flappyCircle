# FlappyBird clone
### Practicing javascript game design with a simple p5.js library.

As you can already tell, this is a complete knockoff of flappyBird as I followed
a tutorial with [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)

I am currently studying computer engineering and just looking to practice my
programming. If you have any suggestions or even just want to collaborate feel
free to send an [email to me](mailto:iwillridgley@gmail.com)

I hope you enjoy this small game! Updates will be coming when time is allotted
in my busy college schedule.
